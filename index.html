    <p>Call it a New York weakness, but we had to make a brownie that crossed cheesecake with fudge. The result was this decadent treat: creamy, a little tart, but very fudgy. As a bonus, these brownies are great right out of the freezer, like frozen candy bars. If you really want to load it on, ice them with Chocolate Fudge Frosting (page 156).</p>

    <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional for the pan</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped, or semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped 10 tablespoons (1 stick plus 2 tablespoons) unsalted butter, plus additional for the pan, at room temperature</li>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese, softened 1 3/4 cups sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Position the rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350F. Butter and flour a 9X13-inch baking pan; set it aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt until well combined. Set aside</li>
        <li>Place both kids of chocolate in the top of a double broiler set over simmering water. If you don't have a double boiler, place both kids of chocolate in a heat-safe bowlthat fits snugly over a small pot of simmering water. Stir consantly until half the chocolate is melted. Remove the top of the double broiler or the bowl from the pot; then continue stiring, away from the heat, until he chocolate is completely melted. Allow to cool for 5 minutes. (To melt chocolate in a microwave, see pages 9-10.)</li>
        <li>In a lage bowl, cream the butter, cream cheese, and sugar with an electric mixer at medium speed; continue beating until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is thick and smooth, abouth 5 minutes. beat in the melted chocolate until smooth and uniform, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating each in thoroughly before adding the next. Beat in the egg yolk and vanilla.</li>
        <li>With a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula, stir in the flour mixture just until incorporated. Do not beat. Pour the bater into the prepared pan, spreading it gently to the corners.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick or cake tester comes out with a few moist crumbs attached. The middle may be soft but it should be set. Set the pan on a wire rack to cool for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Cut the brownies into 24 pieces while they're still in the pan. Carefully remove them with an offset spatula. Serve immediately, or let cool completely before covering with plastic wrap for storage at room temperature. They will stay fresh for up to 4 days. The brownies can also be tighly wrapped in wax paper, sealed in a freezer-safe bag, and frozen for up to 4 months; allow them to thaw at room temperature befor serving.</li>
